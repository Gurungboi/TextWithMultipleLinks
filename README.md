`TextWithMultipleLinks` is a **SwiftUI** component designed to simplify embedding multiple clickable links within a single block of text. This component dynamically highlights specific substrings as links, applies custom styles (font, color, etc.), and associates actions with those links. It eliminates the need to use multiple `Text` views for each link, making your code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain.

This solution is ideal for scenarios such as legal disclaimers, terms of service, or any other text that requires interactive elements.

## üåü Features

- **Dynamic Link Highlighting**: Automatically detects and highlights specified substrings within the text as clickable links.
- **Customizable Styling**: Supports custom font styles, text colors, and link colors.
- **Action Binding**: Each link can be associated with a unique action, enabling flexible interactivity.
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Links are matched case-insensitively, ensuring robustness in text processing.
- **Accessibility Support**: Combines all text elements into a single accessibility element for better screen reader support.
- **Sheet Integration**: Easily integrate modals (sheets) triggered by link taps for additional interactivity.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Example

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {

    let fullText: String = "Google is a search engine and Apple is a company"

    @State private var didClickedOnGoogle: Bool = false
    @State private var didClickedOnApple: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextWithMultipleLinks(
                fullText: fullText,
                links: [
                    ("Google", {
                        didClickedOnGoogle.toggle()
                    }),
                    ("Apple", {
                        didClickedOnApple.toggle()
                    })
                ]
            )
            .sheet(isPresented: $didClickedOnGoogle) {
                GoogleSheetView()
            }
            .sheet(isPresented: $didClickedOnApple) {
                AppleSheetView()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct GoogleSheetView: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("You tapped on Google!")
                .font(.title)
                .padding()
            Button("Dismiss") {
                dismiss()
            }
            .padding()
        }
    }
}

struct AppleSheetView: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("You tapped on Apple!")
                .font(.title)
                .padding()
            Button("Dismiss") {
                dismiss()
            }
            .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`fullText`**: The complete string that contains both regular text and the substrings to be highlighted as links.
2. **`links`**: An array of tuples where each tuple specifies:
   - `text`: The substring to be highlighted as a link.
   - `action`: A closure executed when the link is tapped.
3. **Sheets**: When a link is tapped, a sheet is presented using SwiftUI's `.sheet` modifier. For example, tapping "Google" presents a modal with details about Google.

## üé® Customization

### Font Style

You can customize the font style by passing a different `Font` value to the `textStyle` parameter:

```swift
TextWithMultipleLinks(
    fullText: "Welcome to our platform!",
    textStyle: .headline,
    textColor: .gray,
    links: [
        (text: "platform", action: {
            print("Platform link clicked!")
        })
    ]
)
```

### Link Color

The default link color is blue, but you can modify it by adjusting the `foregroundColor` property in the `renderTextWithLinks` method.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Attributed Strings**:
   - The component uses `AttributedString` to apply custom attributes (e.g., color, link) to specific ranges of the text.
   - Links are assigned a custom URL scheme (`action://link/<index>`) to identify which link was tapped.

2. **OpenURLAction**:
   - The `OpenURLAction` environment is used to handle link taps. When a link is clicked, the corresponding action is executed based on the URL's path.

3. **Case-Insensitive Matching**:
   - The `findCaseInsensitiveRange` helper function ensures that links are matched regardless of case, improving flexibility.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - The `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` modifier ensures that all text elements are treated as a single accessibility element, improving usability for screen readers.

## üìä Benefits

- **Code Efficiency**: Reduces boilerplate code by handling multiple links in a single `Text` view.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent styling and behavior across all links.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adaptable to various use cases, such as legal documents, FAQs, or promotional content.
- **Sheet Integration**: Provides seamless integration with SwiftUI sheets for enhanced interactivity.
